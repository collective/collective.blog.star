1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- No changes yet.


1.1 (2012-04-17)
----------------

This version tested with Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.4 and 4.2b2.

It installs:

    collective.blog.view 1.4
    collective.blog.portlets 1.3
    collective.blog.feeds 1.3

**Note:** When upgrading from Plone 4.0 to Plone 4.1, you need to import the
"Plone Discussions" profile in portal_setup before the Blog View will work.

- Starting with 1.1, collective.blog.star will now pin the versions of
  collective.blog.view, collective.blog.portlets arnbd collective.blog.feeds.
  The main reason for this is to make a sort of "Known Good Set" of these
  modules without forcing you to use specific versions of other modules
  that change much more often.

  It also forces updates of collective.blog.star, which otherwise looks
  like it is unmaintained, when it is not.


1.0 (2010-06-05)
